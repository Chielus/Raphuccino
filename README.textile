h1. Raphuccino: RaphaelJS meets Cappuccino

Raphuccino is a Cappuccino Framework that provides an Objective-J API for the RaphaelJS JavaScript vector graphics library.

Please take a look at "this video":http://www.springenwerk.com/2010/04/introducing-raphuccino.html.

h2. Usage

Copy the Raphuccino folder to your project's Frameworks folder and include @@import <Raphuccino/Raphuccino.j>@ in your class/controller/whatever.
Then create your RCRaphaelView as you would create a normal CPView, or use Atlas and a custom view and set it's class to RCRaphaelView.

The code is commented very well and the demo project and the RaphaelJS docs should cover the rest.

Have fun!
